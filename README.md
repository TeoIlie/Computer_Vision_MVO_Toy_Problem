## Overview
This is built based on this toolkit -  https://github.com/paaraujo/advercity-toolkit/tree/main - which uses the AdverCity database - https://labs.cs.queensu.ca/quarrg/datasets/adver-city/.

* `sift.ipynb` implements SIFT feature detection and brute-force matching to accomplish Monocular Visual Odometry (MVO), and compares it against the ground truth.
* `test.ipynb` shows a visualization of Harris corner detection, and plots a graph of the ground truth.
